# Case Study Proposal: Decentral

## What Is It

Decentral is an innovation hub for disruptive and decentralized technologies. Decentral was home to Canada’s first two-way Bitcoin ATM and from time to time hosts community-driven events in the domains of fintech, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies. Our purpose is to champion the decentralized movement by building the technology that empowers and creates wins for all.
## Why This Matters

In late 2013 Anthony Di Iorio funded & co-founded Ethereum, the decentralized smart contract platform that at its peak hit $200 billion in market cap. In 2014 he founded what is now Decentral Inc., an innovation hub & software development company focused on decentralized technologies. Decentral is the maker of Jaxx Classic & Jaxx Liberty, digital asset platforms that empower millions of people with the tools they need to control their digital lives..
Decentralized technologies power trust-less, frictionless, efficient networks and markets by enabling people to create, store, transfer and receive value from anyone, anywhere — friends, strangers, colleagues, businesses — without the assistance or cost of traditional middlemen. As a result, every sector—from marketing to manufacturing, from healthcare to energy, from law to accounting — is being disrupted. Join us in our mission to create opportunity and empower individuals around the world.
